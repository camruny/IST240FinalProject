            Welcome to PSU Asteroids.  To begin a new game, choose "New Game" from the main menu. To set the difficulty of the game, choose "Options" from the main menu.  Once you are in the game, click on the space ship in the center of the screen to select it.  Your mission is to use your arrow keys to move the ship around space, and press the spacebar to shoot.  Try to shoot as many asteroids as you can without letting one hit you.  Once an asteroid hits you, the game ends.
