            This is a Penn State themed game in which you shoot down footballs to try to get the high score. Our game was inspired by Blockbreakers and Asteroids with the idea to create a game that was simple yet very much enjoyable. Please enjoy the game we made for IST 240.
            This game was created By: Cameron Runyeon, Ryan Spatz, and Jonathan Cesari.
